[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-dab8c7)

# Purpose of the project is to 
# - integrate CK5Editor document version with angular
# - trial html document export to pdf

# Findings by far
# Not compiling with ivy
# PDF generator output is not identical, some issues exist (see long document)
# Inclusion of images with CK5Editor not working. Does it require some plugin ?
# CK5Editor instructions to add: div class="document-editor__editable hides change events.


# TODOs
# Does it compile with production build ?
