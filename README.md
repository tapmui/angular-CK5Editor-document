# angular-ivy-dab8c7

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-dab8c7)

## Purpose of the project is to 
 - integrate CK5Editor document version with angular
 - changing document template to be edited from the dropdown
 - trial html document export to pdf

## Findings by far
 - Not compiling with ivy
 - PDF generator output is not identical, some issues exist (see long document)
 - Inclusion of images with CK5Editor not working. Does it require some plugin ?
 
## TODOs
 - Does it compile with production build ?
 - Better PDF generator
 - Image Inclusion
 - Add generated page as "static web page"
